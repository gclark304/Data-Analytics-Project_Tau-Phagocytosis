# Data-Analytics-Project_Tau-Phagocytosis
Analysis of murine macrophage phagocytosis of tau over circadian time using fluorescence microscopy data. This repository includes initial and pre-processing steps to determine if the phagocytosis is circadian and what variables are significant as well as a decision tree model to group the cells by time point based on cell size and fluorescence.
